        <h1>MODULE 1 - Emergent Reading and Writing Skills</h1>
        <img src='media/tutorials/year1.arts.unit1.module1.ataglance.png' width=95% height=95% class='float_right'>
       	<p><h3>Warm up - 10 minutes.</h3><h4>Counting with Fingers.</h4>
	<blockquote><strong>Note:</strong> In this exercise students will practice counting to 10 using their fingers.
	This task is important because it visually emphasizes that a word (one, two,
	etc.) is an individual entity that can be represented, in this case, with fingers.
	This exercise will be repeated at the beginning of each lesson in Module 1. If you
	find that counting to 10 is too difficult for students at this point, have them
	count to five and increase to 10 when students are ready.</blockquote>
	<ul><li>Count from one to 10, lifting one finger for each number as you count.</li>
	<li>Have students repeat after you.</li></ul></p>

	<p><h3>Listening to Environmental Noises - 20 minutes.</h3><h4>Knocking and Counting. <small>10 minutes</small></h4>
	<blockquote><strong>Note:</strong> This exercise is important because it requires students to distinguish
	discrete noises (in this case, knocks). This is similar to distinguishing
	discrete sounds in spoken words. The ability to distinguish sounds is a
	prerequisite for writing; to write a word, you must know how many sounds
	are in the word so you can write a spelling for each sound.</blockquote>
	<ul><li>Tell students to listen and watch as you knock on your desk.</li>
	<li>Knock on your desk one to three times with your right hand. As you knock,
	raise one finger on your left hand for each knock, starting with your thumb.
	(To students, you should appear to be lifting your fingers from left to right.)</li>
	<li>Repeat the knocks at a slower pace, having students raise one finger for each
	knock (ideally from left to right, but do not dwell on this).</li>
	<li>Have students hold up their hands, indicating with their raised fingers how
	many times you knocked.</li>
	<li>Repeat several times, varying the number of knocks.</li></ul></p>

	<p><h4>Same or Different? <small>10 minutes.</small></h4><hl>
	<blockquote><strong><p>Note:</strong> Note: This exercise familiarizes students with the sources of noises and
	helps them to discriminate between them.</p><p>For this exercise, students need to know the meanings of
	the terms <em>same</em> and <em>different</em>. Make two noises that are the same and tell students two noises that sound alike are the
	<em>same</em>. Make two noises that are different and tell students two noises that do not sound alike are <em>different</em>.</p></blockquote>
	<ul><li>Gather various rhythm instruments or classroom objects which make distinctive noises; e.g., stapler, pencil sharpener, scissors, etc.</li>
	<li>Familiarize students with the instruments or objects and the noises they make by naming them and producing the noises.</li>
	<li>Make two noises and ask students whether the noises were the same or different.</li>
	<li>If students are successful, repeat with the instruments or objects now hidden from view.</li></ul></p>

       	<p><h3>Left/Right Discrimination - 10 minutes.</h3><h4>Greeting.</h4>
	<blockquote><p><strong>Note:</strong> Shaking hands teaches American social skills. Additionally, a firm grip
	develops hand awareness and increases muscle tone in the hand, which is
	useful for writing. Finally, this exercise familiarizes students with their right
	hands (and with the concept of “right” in general). This knowledge will be
	beneficial when students are taught to read and write from left to right.</p><p>Please be aware that greeting
	a person by shaking his or her hand and looking him or her in the eyes is not a universal social tradition. Additionally,
	please note this exercise may be difficult for autistic students</p></blockquote>
	<ul><li>Tell students when we greet a person we shake the person’s right hand.</li><li>Greet one student after the other by saying hello, looking him or her in the
	eyes, and firmly shaking his or her right hand.</li><li>Say, “Hello,____ . We greet others by shaking their right hand. I’m using my right hand to shake your right hand.”</li>
	<li>Encourage students to greet you properly, “Hello,____ . I’m using my right hand to shake your right hand.”</li></ul></p>

       	<p><h3>Spatial and Bodily Awareness - 5 minutes.</h3><h4>Follow me.</h4>
	<blockquote><p><strong>Note:</strong>This exercise familiarizes students with position words, which you will use when teaching letter forms and when teaching the directionality
	of reading and writing (top to bottom/left to right). It also develops gross motor skills.</p><p>A squishy object gives
	students plenty of sensory feedback as they move the object in space. If possible,have students use a soft object for this exercise.</blockquote>
	<ul><li>Give each student a beanbag, foam ball, or another small object.</li><li>Have students stand about an arm’s length apart.</li>
	<li>Stand with your back to students and tell them to do what you do.</li>
	<li>Make sure to emphasize the position words <em>top, bottom, over, under, right,other side</em>, and <em>around</em> by saying what you are doing.</li>
	<li>You should do the following actions in order before varying the game:<ul><li>Move the ball to the <strong>top</strong> of your head.</li>
	<li>Lift up your foot and move the ball down to the <strong>bottom</strong> of your foot.</li>
	<li>Raise your arm sideways and move the ball <strong>over</strong> your arm.</li>
	<li>Raise your arm sideways and move the ball <strong>under</strong> your arm.</li>
	<li>Move the ball to the <strong>right</strong> of your body.</li>
	<li>Move the ball to the <strong>other side</strong> of your body.</li>
	<li>Move the ball <strong>around</strong> your legs.</li></ul></li></ul>
	<blockquote><strong>Note:</strong>The position word <em>left</em> is avoided here to emphasize the right hand and right side of the body.</blockquote></p>

       	<p><h3>Drawing - 15 minutes.</h3><h4>Drawing on a Vertical Surface.</h4>
	<blockquote><strong>Note:</strong> In this exercise students will learn to control movement at the shoulder, elbow, wrist, and fingers to make marks on paper with small
	crayons. The small size of the crayons encourages the pincer grasp, which leads into the efficient tripod grip. The tripod grip will be taught in the next
	lesson.</blockquote>
	<ul><li>Set up drawing paper on an easel or some other large, vertical surface at a height students can reach.</li>
	<li>Provide students with small pieces of crayon.</li><li>Have students draw on the vertical surface. Encourage a range of motion,
	from large movements made at the shoulder and elbows to small movements made at the wrists and fingers.</li></ul></p>

        <h1>Saving and Loading</h1>
        <p>The only piece of the UI we haven't talked about is the
          'Save' and 'Erase' buttons on the left panel. These are only
          visible if your browser supports client-side data
          storage. Clicking 'Save' stores your game, so you can pick
          it up again later. There is currently no 'Load' button, the
          game loads when the page loads. There is also no way to save
          multiple games, and select which one you want to play. These
          are both things I'd like to change in the future.
        </p>
        <p>
          Potentially your game could generate huge amounts of
          text. And that would be difficult to store client side
          (there are unpredictable limits), especially when we move
          towards having multiple save files. So instead Undum saves
          your character as the list of links you clicked. Loading a
          save-file consists of playing through your game again,
          quickly. This is a beneficial approach for debugging too. It
          means when you're polishing and correcting typos, you can
          save and load the game and scroll through the transcript to
          see your corrections. If we saved the text, your save file
          would have the error in it and you'd have to manually replay
          the game to see the correction.
        </p>
        <p class='transient'>
          Let's return to the <a href='hub'>module list</a>.
        </p>
      </div>

      <!-- Some situations defined entirely in the HTML -->
      <div id="hub" class="situation" data-choices="#module"
           data-option-text="View Module List">
        <h1 class="transient">Modules</h1>
        <p class="transient">Choose a module to continue. Please, go through the modules in order.</p>
      </div>

      <div id="implicit" class="situation" data-tags="module"
           data-heading="Implicit Choices" data-display-order="7"
           data-choices="#example">
        <p>When you're writing an Undum game, you often need certain
          options to be available only when certain conditions hold. You
          might have an option to remove a secret panel in a haunted
          house, but that should only be visible if the character knows
          where it is. If options are available in lots of situations, it
          can be very difficult to keep track of what options are
          allowed, and to produce just the right list of choices.</p>
        <p>To help with this, Undum can generate a list of situation
          links for you. It does this in three steps. Firstly, each
          situation can be given one or more tags, this allows you to
          easily ask for links to all situations with the 'in-hallway'
          tag, for example. Secondly, situations can have
          a <em>canView</em> method, which gets to decide whether that
          situation should appear. That method can look at the
          current state of the character to decide whether to appear
          or not. Thirdly, <em>SimpleSituation</em>s have a <em>choices</em>
          option. If it is set to one or more tags, it handles the building
          of the choice list.</p>
        <p>You've seen this already in the module list. The module list
          is generated automatically. All of the situations in the module
          list are always available, however.
          <span class="transient">So here is an example of
          automatic options that may change:</span></p>

        <p class="transient">You can return to the

          this example:</p>
