        <p>This unit focuses on the scientific concept of using pushes and pulls to put objects in\
	motion, increase or decrease the objectâ€™s speed, change direction, or stop motion.</p>\
	\
	<p>Students are familiar with various games that involve the movement of objects, such as a ball. They\
	may not make the connection that the motion of a ball is affected by the strength and direction of\
	pushes and pulls on the ball. Students will explore this concept with both visible and invisible pushes\
	and pulls, contact and noncontact forces. They will recognize that motion is affected by the strength\
	and direction of pushes and pulls, the characteristics of objects, and the surface on which objects are\
	moved. Students will learn how motion changes and develop an understanding that pushes and pulls\
	of all different types are the cause of all changes in movement.</p>\
	\
	<p>In this unit, students investigate what causes changes in motion by exploring pushes and pulls.\
	Students will then use prior knowledge and information gained from their observations during various\
	tests to design a miniature golf course. Students explore concepts that include the following:\
	<ul><li>Pushes and pulls can have different strengths and directions.</li>\
	<li>Pushing and pulling on an object can change the speed or direction of its motion and can start\
	or stop it.</li></ul></p>\
        \
        <p>Engineers and engineering designers use knowledge of forces and motion as they develop solutions\
	to problems and make things that are useful to people. This series of lessons incorporates learning\
	goals that support the principles and practices of engineering design, such as defining problems and\
	evaluating and optimizing possible solutions.</p>\
