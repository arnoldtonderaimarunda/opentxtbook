        <h1>MODULE 1 - Where Do You Live?</h1>
     	<p><h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>Ask students to tell you where they live.</p>
        <p>Students are likely to respond in many different ways; accept and reinforce any reasonable response.
	For example, one student may respond that she lives near the school; another student may respond
	that he lives in a house; and yet another student may respond with the name of the city or town or
	street where she lives.</p>
        <p>Show students a photo of Earth. Explain that this is a picture of how our world, which we also call Earth, looks from outer space.</p>
	<p>Tell students that as you read this book aloud to them, you are going to pretend that you are going on a trip to visit many different places around the world. 
	Many of the places that you will visit are far away from where you and the students are now, so you are going to ask them to
	pretend that you are all going to get on an airplane to visit places that may be far away.</p>
	<p>Ask if any students have ever traveled on a real airplane and, if so, where they went.</p>
	<p>Ask students to make sure that they buckle their seat belts and are ready for the plane to take off. 
	Tell students that today they are going to visit some different places where people live.
	Count backward, saying, “3 . . . 2 . . . 1 . . . We’re off!”</p>
	<p>Encourage students to join you in making airplane engine sounds for several seconds,
	but explain that this is a super fast plane, so they need to listen carefully for the announcement
	from the pilot, who will let them know when they have landed.</p>
	<p>Tell students that the plane has landed, and ask them to unbuckle their seat belts.</p>


       	<p><h3>Big Question</h3>
	Where do people live?</p>

	<p><h4>Core Vocabulary</h4>
	<blockquote><p><strong>Note:</strong> Core Vocabulary terms are those that students should learn to use accurately

	<p><h3>Read Together</h3><h4>"Where Do You Live?"</h4>
	<blockquote><strong>Note:</strong> While some advanced students may be able to read words on a given student worksheet, as a general rule students should not be expected or asked to read
	aloud the text on the worksheet pages. The text in the worksheet is there so that teachers and parents can read it when sharing the worksheet with students.</blockquote>
     	<strong><p style="color:blue;">&#8623; Download <a href='media/societies.unit1.module1.worksheet-where_do_you_live.pdf' class='sticky' target='_blank'>Where Do You Live?</a> worksheet.</p></strong>
	<ul><li>Ask students to turn to page 2 and look at the picture as you read aloud. Remind them that the title of the story is “Where Do You Live?” 
	and tell them to pay pay special attention to the different kinds of places where people might live.<ul><li>Explain that a <em>town</em> is a place that has streets and houses where people
	live. There are usually also different stores where people can shop in a town..</li>
	<li>Explain that a <em>city</em> is a place with many streets and many buildings, where
	lots of people live. The buildings in a city are usually larger and taller than a house. Cities also have
	different stores where people can shop—usually more stores than you would find in a town.</li>
	<li><strong>Ask students to look at the picture of the apartment building compared to the picture of the house.</strong> Explain that many more people can live in one tall apartment building than
	in one house</li>
	<li>Explain that a <em>farm</em> is a place with lots of land that is used for growing plants and raising animals that can be eaten as food.</li>
	<li>Ask students if they have ever been to a farm. What did they see? What did they
	hear? What did they smell? Did they touch anything? Then ask students if they think farms are
	important. Discuss how farms provide different kinds of food for people that help them live and
	survive. Point out to students that even if they live in the city and don’t have any farms nearby,
	much of the food that they buy in city stores comes from farms.</li>
	<li>Explain that the <em>countryside</em> is a place where there is lots of land and
	open space, where houses are not close together or next to one another. You can find farms in the
	countryside.</li>
	<li>Explain that a <em>river</em> is a large stream of flowing, fresh water.</li>
	<li>Ask students to point to the river in the image on the lower right side of the
	page. Be sure they understand that a river is different from the pond shown in the farm image on
	the lower left side of the page. The water in a river is always moving or flowing from one place to
	another; the water in a pond stays where it is.</li></ul></li>
	<li>Ask students to describe where they live. Is it a town, city, or farm?</li>
	<li>Ask if anyone has taken a trip to a place that is different from the place where
	they live. Were there more or fewer buildings? How else was the place different? Were there any
	buildings in sight? Have they hiked in a forest or the mountains? Have they been to an ocean
	beach? Encourage them to compare those places with the place where they live.</li>
	<li>Ask students the following questions:<ul><li>What are some different kinds of places where people can live? &#10174; People can live in houses, apartments, and even on boats.</li>
	<li>Why do you think people live in so many different kinds of homes?  &#10174; There are so many different kinds of homes to live in because people are different and like
	different things. The world is not the same everywhere, so the kinds of homes in which people
	live are often different, based on where in the world they live.</li></ul></li>
	</ul>


	<ul><li>Ask students to turn to page 3 and look at the picture as you read aloud.<ul>
	<li>Explain that a <em>neighborhood</em> is a part of a town or city where people live near one another. Cities have many different neighborhoods.</li>
	<li>Explain that a <em>province</em> is a specific area within a country. Many, many neighborhoods, towns, and large areas of countryside make up a province. Give an example.</li>
	<li>Explain that a <em>country</em> is a place with a government and laws for all the people who live there. Give an example.</li>
	<li>If students do not know the name of the state or country in which they live, provide the correct answer and ask students to repeat it.</li>
	<li>Explain that a <em>government</em> is a group of people who make rules and decisions for a country, state, or city.</li>
	<li>Explain that <em>laws</em> are rules made by a government. Many laws are meant to keep people safe, such as the law that requires people to wear seat belts in cars.</li>
	</ul></li></ul>
	<blockquote><strong>Note:</strong> Students this age will have only a limited understanding of the terms government and laws. The words are introduced here only for an initial exposure.</blockquote>
	<p>To help students understand the relation and differences among these different areas,
	draw concentric circles with <em>home</em> at the center, followed by <em>neighborhood, town</em> or <em>city</em>, then <em>province</em>,
	and then <em>country</em> to convey how all of these places are interrelated. As you describe each circle,
	starting from home and moving outward, use the names specific to the area where your students
	live for at least the town or city, state, and country.</p></p>

     	<strong><p style="color:blue;">&#8623; Download <a href='media/societies.unit1.module1.worksheet-finding_your_way_around.pdf' class='sticky' target='_blank'>Finding Your Way Around</a> worksheet.</p></strong>
	<ul><li>Ask students to turn to page 4 and look at the picture as you read aloud. <strong>Ask students what “finding your way around” means</strong>. Students should understand
	that it is a saying that doesn’t literally mean finding a way around specific objects or things; rather, it has a general meaning about knowing or discovering where you are and 
	where you are going.<ul><li>Explain that <em>maps</em> are drawings of a place. Maps can show anywhere from a very small place, such as a classroom or a city or town, to a very large place, 
	such as a province or a country.</li>
	<li>Point out the maps in the images on page 4.</li>
	<li>Ask students if they have seen their parents or other adults using <strong>electronic devices, such as a phone or a GPS in a car</strong>, to find their way.</li>
	<li>How do maps help us?   &#10174; Maps can help us understand our world. They can help us find our way around and how to get from one place to another .</li>
	<li>Ask students to look at the map of California in the United States of Amercia(USA) on page 5, which shows major cities and highways in the state. Help students understand that 
	the different colors on the map do not represent different states, only different parts of one state.</li>
	<li>Ask students if they can find particular stateson the map. Write the abbreviation for the state on the board, and then guide them in finding the state on the map of the United States.</li>
	<li>Point out the blue areas on the left and right sides of the map of the United States on page 5, and explain that the color blue on maps is generally used to represent places where there is
	water. Explain that these are very large areas of water called oceans.</li>
	<li>Explain that <em>oceans</em> are very large bodies of water found at different places around the world. The water in oceans is called salt water because if you were to taste it, it would
	taste like you had put salt in the water.</li></ul></li></ul>

	<p>Tell students that the large body of water on the left side of the map, next to the states of CA, OR, and WA, is called the Pacific Ocean. 
	The large body of water on the right side of the map, which is next to many different states, is called the Atlantic Ocean.</p>
	<p><strong>Ask students if anyone has ever visited or seen an ocean.</strong> If so, ask students to describe what they saw and did. Explain that many people take vacations to visit and swim
	in oceans.</p>
	<p>Mention to students that the thin blue lines that they see in the book at other places on the map of the United States are rivers; only very large rivers are shown on this map of the 
	United States. Tell them that rivers are much smaller than oceans. Rivers have fresh water, not salt water.</p></p>
	
	<ul><li>Now ask students to look at the images on page 6 as you read aloud.<ul><li>Explain that a <em>continent</em> is one of the largest areas of land on Earth.
	Make clear that usually there are several countries located on a continent. </li>
	<li>Ask students what continent they live on.</li>
	<li>Point out and name each of the seven continents shown on the map, but tell students that they are not expected to remember the name of every continent right now. They will learn
	more about each continent throughout the year.</li></ul></li></ul>

	<p>Now show students a globe. Explain that a <em>globe is a small</em>, round model of the world. Tell students that the world is actually round. 
	This globe is a small model of the world with the kind of map shown on page 6 pasted on the round model</p>
	<p>Point to the approximate location on the globe where you and your students live. Point to the closest ocean to where you live and name it.</p>

	<ul><li>Ask students the following questions:<ul><li>What is a continent? &#10174; A continent is large area of land.</li>
	<li>How many continents are there? &#10174; There are seven continents</li><li>How are oceans shown on a map or globe?  &#10174; They are shown in blue.</li>
	</ul></li></ul>

	<ul><li>Show students a globe as you read aloud the first three sentences on page 7. Then ask students to look at the images on page 7 as you read the rest of the page aloud<ul>
	<li>Explain that the <em>North Pole</em> is the most northern point on Earth. It is located near the top of the globe. Explain that the <em>South Pole</em> is the most southern point on Earth.
	It is located near the bottom of the globe.</li>
	<li><strong>Show students the North Pole and the South Pole on both the page 6 of worksheet map and on the globe.</strong></li><li>How are oceans shown on a map or globe? &#10174; They are shown in blue.</li>
	<li>Explain that <em>Earth</em> is another name for our world</li><li><strong>Direct students to look at the image of Earth at the bottom of page 7</strong>. Explain
	that the blue represents water, the green and yellow-orange represent areas of land, and the white
	represents clouds and ice.</li></ul></li></ul>
	<ul><li>Ask students the following questions:<ul><li>What shape is Earth? &#10174; Earth is round, like a ball</li>
	<li>What is a globe? &#10174; A globe is a round model of Earth.</li><li>How is a globe different from a map? &#10174; A globe is a round object that you can turn and see from all sides. 
	A map is a flat drawing.</li>
	</ul></li></ul>

	<p><h3>Check for Understanding</h3>
	<p>How are maps helpful, and what kinds of information might you find on a map?  &#10174; Answers may vary but may include the following: maps are helpful because they show where
	we are in the world and how to get from one place to another; different maps can show different places; maps can show cities, states, countries, and continents; they can show rivers
	and oceans; they can also show the North and South Poles.</p>
	<p><strong>Play the “Seven Continents Song” and "Five Oceans Song" two or three more times,
	encouraging students to sing along to the chorus as they pick up the words. We have added an
	option to sing the song at the end of each chapter so that the names of the continents will stick
	in students’ minds.</strong></p>

	<p><h3>Additional Activity</h3><h4>Positional Words</h4>
     	<p>Play a game of Simon Says in which all of the directions make use of the following positional words:
	<em>between, in the middle of, next to, beside, around, far from, near, above, below, to the right of, to the left of, here</em>, and <em>there.</em></p>
	<p>Begin first by explaining the rules for Simon Says: if you give a direction to do something beginning with the phrase “Simon says,” students should perform the direction; 
	if you give a direction that does not begin with “Simon says,” students should not perform the direction. If students fail to do
	what Simon says, they are out. And, if students move when you do not include “Simon says” in your instructions, they are out. The last student standing wins</p>
	</p>
	<p>Be creative in coming up with a variety of different directions. You might start out by telling all of the students that Simon says to hold hands and form a circle. 
	Then you might say, “Simon says, the boys should go the <em>middle, inside the circle</em>.”Then continue, for example, by calling out the name of one boy and saying, “(Boy’s name), Simon says,
	<em>go stand between (a female student’s name) and (another female student’s name).</em>”</p>

	<p>Continue in the same way, making use of the different positional words, students’ names, and the objects and features of your classroom, e.g., “Simon says, <em>Go stand next to</em> the classroom
	door.” Remember to occasionally give a direction that is not preceded by “Simon says” to make sure students are listening carefully.</p>

	<h4>Making and Using a Map</h4>
	<blockquote><strong>Note:</strong> The purpose of this activity is to introduce students to the idea of a map. When you are finished, help students see how the map represents what 
	is included in their room and how they can use the map to locate people, things (such as desks), and places (such as doors or windows).</blockquote>
	<strong><p style="color:blue;">&#8623; Download example maps at <a href='media/societies.unit1.module1.worksheet-ap_1.2.pdf' class='sticky' target='_blank'>CKHG Online</a> Resources.</p></strong>
	<p></p></p>
	<p>Show students examples of different paper maps, and ask if they know what these pieces of paper are called or if they have ever seen anyone using something like this. 
	Explain that these are called maps. Maps are drawings of a place. Maps can show a very small place, such as a town or city, or larger places, such as a province, country, or even the world.</p>
	<p><strong>Use this opportunity to ask students to review and name the town or city, state, and country in which they live.</strong></p>
	<p>Mention that students may have seen an adult use a map to figure out how to get from one place to another when walking or driving. Explain that when their grandparents were children, paper maps
	were the only kinds of maps available for people to use.</p>
	<p>Display a screen shot of online mapping services such as <em>Bing Maps/Google Maps/MapQuest</em> etc and explain that, thanks to the internet, computers, and cell phones,
	people can now find and get maps in other ways. For demonstration purposes, enter the address of your school as the starting location and another nearby address as the destination, 
	so that students can watch as the map of the area appears on the screen. Explain how the map represents an area, including
	streets, buildings, parks, etc</p>
	<p>Now ask students to watch as you draw a map of your classroom, showing and describing the locations of different objects and places, such as windows, doors, tables, desks, 
	closets, and any other identifiable features of your learning space.</p>
	<p>Once the map is complete, have students indicate where they are in the classroom on the map. Help students see how they can use the map to locate other things</p>
	<p><strong>Prior to the lesson, hide a special object or two somewhere in your classroom. Give students step-by-step directions, using the classroom map, 
	that guide them to the location of the hidden object.</strong></p>
