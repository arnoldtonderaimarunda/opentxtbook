        <h1>MODULE 1 - Where Do You Live?</h1>
     	<p><h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>Ask students to tell you where they live.</p>
        <p>Students are likely to respond in many different ways; accept and reinforce any reasonable response.
	For example, one student may respond that she lives near the school; another student may respond
	that he lives in a house; and yet another student may respond with the name of the city or town or
	street where she lives.</p>
        <p>Show students a photo of Earth. Explain that this is a picture of how our world, which we also call Earth, looks from outer space.</p>
	<p>Tell students that as you read this book aloud to them, you are going to pretend that you are going on a trip to visit many different places around the world. 
	Many of the places that you will visit are far away from where you and the students are now, so you are going to ask them to
	pretend that you are all going to get on an airplane to visit places that may be far away.</p>
	<p>Ask if any students have ever traveled on a real airplane and, if so, where they went.</p>
	<p>Ask students to make sure that they buckle their seat belts and are ready for the plane to take off. 
	Tell students that today they are going to visit some different places where people live.
	Count backward, saying, “3 . . . 2 . . . 1 . . . We’re off!”</p>
	<p>Encourage students to join you in making airplane engine sounds for several seconds,
	but explain that this is a super fast plane, so they need to listen carefully for the announcement
	from the pilot, who will let them know when they have landed.</p>
	<p>Tell students that the plane has landed, and ask them to unbuckle their seat belts.</p>


       	<p><h3>Big Question</h3>
	Where do people live?</p>

	<p><h4>Core Vocabulary</h4>
	<blockquote><p><strong>Note:</strong> Core Vocabulary terms are those that students should learn to use accurately
	in discussion and responses. During instruction, expose students repeatedly to these
	terms. However, these terms are not intended for isolated drill or memorisation.</blockquote>

	<p><h3>Read Together</h3><h4>"Where Do You Live?"</h4>
	<blockquote><strong>Note:</strong> While some advanced students may be able to read words on a given student worksheet, as a general rule students should not be expected or asked to read
	aloud the text on the worksheet pages. The text in the worksheet is there so that teachers and parents can read it when sharing the worksheet with students.</blockquote>
     	<strong><p style="color:blue;">&#8623; Download <a href='media/societies.unit1.module1.worksheet-where_do_you_live.pdf' class='sticky' target='_blank'>Where Do You Live?</a> worksheet.</p></strong>
	<ul><li>Ask students to turn to page 2 and look at the picture as you read aloud. Remind them that the title of the story is “Where Do You Live?” 
	and tell them to pay pay special attention to the different kinds of places where people might live.<ul><li>Explain that a <em>town</em> is a place that has streets and houses where people
	live. There are usually also different stores where people can shop in a town..</li>
	<li>Explain that a <em>city</em> is a place with many streets and many buildings, where
	lots of people live. The buildings in a city are usually larger and taller than a house. Cities also have
	different stores where people can shop—usually more stores than you would find in a town.</li>
	<li><strong>Ask students to look at the picture of the apartment building compared to the picture of the house.</strong> Explain that many more people can live in one tall apartment building than
	in one house</li>
	<li>Explain that a <em>farm</em> is a place with lots of land that is used for growing plants and raising animals that can be eaten as food.</li>
	<li>Ask students if they have ever been to a farm. What did they see? What did they
	hear? What did they smell? Did they touch anything? Then ask students if they think farms are
	important. Discuss how farms provide different kinds of food for people that help them live and
	survive. Point out to students that even if they live in the city and don’t have any farms nearby,
	much of the food that they buy in city stores comes from farms.</li>
	<li>Explain that the <em>countryside</em> is a place where there is lots of land and
	open space, where houses are not close together or next to one another. You can find farms in the
	countryside.</li>
	<li>Explain that a <em>river</em> is a large stream of flowing, fresh water.</li>
	<li>Ask students to point to the river in the image on the lower right side of the
	page. Be sure they understand that a river is different from the pond shown in the farm image on
	the lower left side of the page. The water in a river is always moving or flowing from one place to
	another; the water in a pond stays where it is.</li></ul></li>
	<li>Ask students to describe where they live. Is it a town, city, or farm?</li>
	<li>Ask if anyone has taken a trip to a place that is different from the place where
	they live. Were there more or fewer buildings? How else was the place different? Were there any
	buildings in sight? Have they hiked in a forest or the mountains? Have they been to an ocean
	beach? Encourage them to compare those places with the place where they live.</li>
	<li>Ask students the following questions:<ul><li>What are some different kinds of places where people can live? &#10174; People can live in houses, apartments, and even on boats.</li>
	<li>Why do you think people live in so many different kinds of homes?  &#10174; There are so many different kinds of homes to live in because people are different and like
	different things. The world is not the same everywhere, so the kinds of homes in which people
	live are often different, based on where in the world they live.</li></ul></li>
	</ul>


	<ul><li>Ask students to turn to page 3 and look at the picture as you read aloud.<ul>
	<li>Explain that a <em>neighborhood</em> is a part of a town or city where people live near one another. Cities have many different neighborhoods.</li>
	<li>Explain that a <em>province</em> is a specific area within a country. Many, many neighborhoods, towns, and large areas of countryside make up a province. Give an example.</li>
	<li>Explain that a <em>country</em> is a place with a government and laws for all the people who live there. Give an example.</li>
	<li>If students do not know the name of the state or country in which they live, provide the correct answer and ask students to repeat it.</li>
	<li>Explain that a <em>government</em> is a group of people who make rules and decisions for a country, state, or city.</li>
	<li>Explain that <em>laws</em> are rules made by a government. Many laws are meant to keep people safe, such as the law that requires people to wear seat belts in cars.</li>
	</ul></li></ul>
	<blockquote><strong>Note:</strong> Students this age will have only a limited understanding of the terms government and laws. The words are introduced here only for an initial exposure.</blockquote>
	<p>To help students understand the relation and differences among these different areas,
	draw concentric circles with <em>home</em> at the center, followed by <em>neighborhood, town</em> or <em>city</em>, then <em>province</em>,
	and then <em>country</em> to convey how all of these places are interrelated. As you describe each circle,
	starting from home and moving outward, use the names specific to the area where your students
	live for at least the town or city, state, and country.</p></p>

        <h1>MODULE 2 - Finding Your Way Around</h1>
     	<p><h3>Overview</h3>
        <blockquote><p><strong>Big Question:</strong> How can pushes and pulls change motion of objects?</p>
        <p><strong>Guiding Questions:</strong> What do pushes and pulls do? What happens when something moves?</p>
        <p><strong>Tie to Anchoring Phenomenon:</strong> Students engage with moving objects as firsthand experience
	with types and causes of motion that occur in sports games and other activities.</p></blockquote>

	<p><h3>Core Vocabulary & Language of Instruction</h3><h4>Core Vocabulary</h4>
	<blockquote><p><strong>Note:</strong> Core Vocabulary terms are those that students should learn to use accurately
	in discussion and responses. During instruction, expose students repeatedly to these
	terms. However, these terms are not intended for isolated drill or memorisation.</blockquote>

	<p><h3>Introduction</h3>
	<blockquote><strong>Note:</strong> <p>Students ask and answer questions about their experiences and observations of the
	cause and effect of different forces and motions.</p><p>Have students look at the question board. Lead the class in reading the <strong>Big Question</strong>
	that you’ll be answering in this unit — <strong>How can pushes and pulls change the motion of objects?</strong></p>
	<p>Tell students that, before they can answer the unit’s Big Question about how pushes and pulls change motion, they first need to understand what pushes and pulls are
	and how they work. In Lesson 1, they will learn about pushes and pulls in order to apply their understanding to the Big Question. Write the <strong>Guiding Question</strong> where 
	students can see it: <strong>What do pushes and pulls do?</strong></p></blockquote>
	<ul><li>Record student responses to this question.<ul><li>What makes something move? &#10174; Something falls. Something is pushed. Something is pulled.</li></ul></li>
	<li>Demonstrate and have students demonstrate a push by pushing a pencil, book,or paper across a desk or floor</li>
	<li>Demonstrate and have students demonstrate a pull by pulling an item.</li>
	<li>Discuss the differences between pushes and pulls. &#10174; A pull is toward you. A push is away from you</li>
	<li>Explain that students are going to go to the playground or gym and experience motion. Ask them each to pick one activity to observe and collect evidence
	about one type of motion. When they return, you will ask each student to describe what caused a motion and what made it stop.</li></ul></p>

	<p><h3>Gather Evidence</h3>
	<blockquote><strong>Note:</strong> Allow students to play on playground equipment and/or use sports equipment for a maximum of ten minutes. 
	Pick a number of activities that will allow students to try out pushes and pulls, such as pushing and pulling each other on the swings or
	rolling, passing, and kicking a ball to each other. Ask them to choose one activity to observe and gather evidence.</blockquote>
	<p>As students explore motion, and ask targeted questions such as the following:</p>
	<ul><li>What is moving?  &#10174; me, the ball, the swing.</li><li>What caused the movement?  &#10174; a push, a pull, falling, sliding.</li></ul></p>
