        <h1>MODULE 1 - Pushes and Pulls</h1>
     	<p><h3>Overview</h3>
        <blockquote><p><strong>Big Question:</strong> How can pushes and pulls change the motion of objects?</p>
        <p><strong>Anchoring Phenomenon:</strong> Sports games are fun because of objects in motion. The driving question we
	explore in this unit is “How can pushes and pulls change motion of objects?” To answer this question in
	depth over the course of the unit, students will explore <strong>pushes and pulls</strong> as they construct a miniature
	golf course. In answering this question, students explore both visible and invisible pushes and pulls,
	contact and noncontact forces. They recognize that motion is affected by the strength and direction of
	pushes and pulls, the characteristics of objects, and the surface on which objects are moved. Students
	learn how motion changes and develop an understanding that pushes and pulls of all different types
	are the cause of all changes of movement.</p>
        <p><strong>Storyline:</strong> Kamal’s scooter rolls to a stop when he stops pushing it forward. Kamal learns about pushes and pulls as he investigates how to change the motion of objects.</p>
        <p><strong>Long-term Project:</strong> Students will explore pushes and pulls as they construct a miniature golf course.</p></blockquote></p>


       	<p><h3>Introducing Anchoring Phenomenon</h3>
	<blockquote><strong>Note:</strong> Introduce the unit by writing the <strong>Big Question</strong> on the board — <strong>How can pushes and pulls change motion of objects?</strong> 
	Then ask each student to do a simple demonstration of a push and a pull. For example, they can push a pencil away from them and pull it toward them.</blockquote>
	<ul><li>Discuss how pushes and pulls are different? &#10174; A push is away from you. A pull is toward you.</li>
	<li>Ask students to think of things they push and pull? Record their ideas on the question board. &#10174; <em>push</em>: a grocery cart, an open door, a closed drawer, someone on a swing;
	&#10174; <em>pull</em>: a wagon, a closed door, an open drawer</li><li>Tell students that in this unit, they will be exploring what causes pushes and
	pulls and how a push or pull changes how and which way things move.</li></ul></p>

	<p><h3>Read Together</h3><h4>"A Scooter Race"</h4>
	<blockquote><strong>Note:</strong> While some advanced students may be able to read words on a given student worksheet, as a general rule students should not be expected or asked to read
	aloud the text on the worksheet pages. The text in the worksheet is there so that teachers and parents can read it when sharing the worksheet with students.</blockquote>
     	<strong><p style="color:blue;">&#8623; Download <a href='media/sciences.unit1.module1.worksheet-a_scooter_race.pdf' class='sticky' target='_blank'>A Scooter Race</a> worksheet.</p></strong>
	<ul><li>Ask students to turn to page 2 and look at the picture as you read aloud. Remind them that the title of the story is “A Scooter Race,” 
	and tell them to pay special attention to how things move as you read.<ul><li>Explain that field day, usually at the end of the school year, is a fun day when
	student teams play sports games to relax after the year’s work is done.</li>
	<li>How many of the students have ridden a scooter?</li><li>Is Kamal pushing or pulling? &#10174; pushing</li>
	<li>What would happen if he stopped pushing? &#10174; scooter would slow down and then stop.</li></ul></li></ul>
	<ul><li>Ask students to turn to page 3 and look at the picture as you read aloud.<ul>
	<li>Why did Maddy win the race? &#10174; She pushed harder than the others.</li>
	<li>What objects move in the picture? &#10174; The scooters and the children.</li><li>Explain the vocabulary <em>move</em>. Means to change position. When something moves, 
	it goes from one place to another. </li></ul></li></ul>
	<ul><li>Ask students to turn to page 4 and 5 and look at the pictures as you read aloud.<ul>
	<li>Discuss different types of games you can play on a field day &#10174; Football, athletics e.t.c.</li>
	<li>Ask students how movement makes sports fun? &#10174; If nothing moved, everyone would just stand and do nothing.</li>
	<li>Compare the different movements in the pictures. &#10174;  Two kids are pushing their scooters to make them move forward. The girl is kicking the soccer ball.</li>
	<li>What is being pushed in the pictures? &#10174; the scooters, the ball, the swing, the seesaw, the bike.</li>
	<li>What is being pulled in the pictures? &#10174; the swing, the wagon.</li>
	<li>Describe the movements in each picture.&#10174; The scooters and ball move forward. The swing is moving forward and backward. The seesaw is moving up and down. The bike is moving forward.
	The wagon is moving forward.</li></ul></li></ul></p>

	<p><h3>Generate Questions</h3>
     	<strong><p style="color:blue;">&#8623; Download and have students complete <a href='media/sciences.unit1.module1.worksheet-apu_0.1.pdf' class='sticky' target='_blank'>Motion</a> worksheet.</p></strong>
	<p>Coach students through completing worksheet. Review students work, and add student responses to the question board lists of pushes and pulls.</p>
	<p>Ask each student to think of a question they have about the pushes and pulls they have encountered. Add these questions to the question board.  &#10174;  
	Why do some things move further and faster than others? How can you make something stop moving? Can things move by themselves?</p>

	<p><h3>Check for Understanding</h3><h4>Formative Assessment</h4>
	<p>Review student responses in the discussion and on worksheet to determine student understanding of the following concepts:</p>
	<ul><li>A push is away from you.</li><li>A pull is toward you.</li><li>When something moves, it goes from one place to another.</li></ul></p>

	<p><h3>Introduction</h3>
	<blockquote><strong>Note:</strong> <p>Students ask and answer questions about their experiences and observations of the
	cause and effect of different forces and motions.</p><p>Have students look at the question board. Lead the class in reading the <strong>Big Question</strong>
	that you’ll be answering in this unit — <strong>How can pushes and pulls change the motion of objects?</strong></p>
	<p>Tell students that, before they can answer the unit’s Big Question about how pushes and pulls change motion, they first need to understand what pushes and pulls are
	and how they work. In Lesson 1, they will learn about pushes and pulls in order to apply their understanding to the Big Question. Write the <strong>Guiding Question</strong> where 
	students can see it: <strong>What do pushes and pulls do?</strong></p></blockquote>
	<ul><li>Record student responses to this question.<ul><li>What makes something move? &#10174; Something falls. Something is pushed. Something is pulled.</li></ul></li>
	<li>Demonstrate and have students demonstrate a push by pushing a pencil, book,or paper across a desk or floor</li>
	<li>Demonstrate and have students demonstrate a pull by pulling an item.</li>
	<li>Discuss the differences between pushes and pulls. &#10174; A pull is toward you. A push is away from you</li>
	<li>Explain that students are going to go to the playground or gym and experience motion. Ask them each to pick one activity to observe and collect evidence
	about one type of motion. When they return, you will ask each student to describe what caused a motion and what made it stop.</li></ul></p>

	<p><h3>Gather Evidence</h3>
	<blockquote><strong>Note:</strong> Allow students to play on playground equipment and/or use sports equipment for a maximum of ten minutes. 
	Pick a number of activities that will allow students to try out pushes and pulls, such as pushing and pulling each other on the swings or
	rolling, passing, and kicking a ball to each other. Ask them to choose one activity to observe and gather evidence.</blockquote>
	<p>As students explore motion, and ask targeted questions such as the following:</p>
	<ul><li>What is moving?  &#10174; me, the ball, the swing.</li><li>What caused the movement?  &#10174; a push, a pull, falling, sliding.</li></ul></p>


	<p><h3>Focus Students Attention</h3><h4>What happens when something moves?</h4>
        <img src='media/tutorials/sciences.unit1.module2.teacherdev1.png' width=95% height=95% class='float_right'>
	<ul><li>Return to the classroom, and have students sit quietly. Then ask the following questions, and record relevant answers on the question board.<ul>
	<li>What can you observe that is moving now? &#10174; e.g., the clock, papers moving due to a breeze, curtain by window, a person breathing</li>
	<li>What is causing the change in the motion? &#10174; e.g., wind, falling, motor, physical energy</li></ul></li>
	<li>Model cause and effect for students. Place a ball on a desktop or other surface where the entire class can observe. Tell students you are going to apply a force
	to the ball and that this will be the cause. The effect is what happens after the cause. Push the ball, and ask:<ul>
	<li>What effect happened when I used a force on the ball? &#10174; The ball started rolling</li></ul></li></ul>
	<strong><p style="color:blue;">&#8623; Download and have students complete <a href='media/sciences.unit1.module2.worksheet-apu_1.1.1.pdf' class='sticky' target='_blank'>Pushing and Pulling</a> worksheet.</p></strong>
 	<img src='media/tutorials/sciences.unit1.module2.teacherdev2.png' width=95% height=95% class='float_right'>
	<ul><li>Ask students to present their observations from the activity by asking these questions of each student.<ul>
	<li>What did you observe moving? &#10174; e.g., a ball, a swing, a person on the slide</li>
	<li>What is caused the change in the motion? &#10174; a push or a pull</li></ul></li>
	<li>Discuss how the movements students observed in the quiet classroom and the movements they observed in the activity are the same and different.<ul>
	<li>Movements were caused by a push or pull or some force.</li><li>Movements went in different directions at different speeds.</li>
	<li>Some movements are caused by pushes. Others are caused by pulls.</li></ul></li></ul>
	<p>Some students may benefit from further demonstrating the physical activity of pushing and pulling different objects in order to secure the difference between the two types of forces.
	A discussion of examples such as wind as pushing and a vacuum as pulling may provide further understanding.</p></p>

	<p><h3>Check for Understanding</h3><h4>Formative Assessment</h4>
	<p>Review student responses in the discussion and on worksheet to determine student understanding of the following concepts:</p>
	<ul><li>Changes in movement are caused by a push or pull on an object.</li><li>A push is away from you. A pull is toward you.</li></ul>
	<blockquote><strong>Note:</strong> Science starts when someone asks a question. Encourage students to ask questions about movement as well as the causes and effects of motion phenomena.
	Record student questions on the question board.</blockquote>
	<p>Tell students that they will be designing a miniature golf course later in the unit and that as part of the design, they will need to consider how they want the ball to roll through
	the different parts of the course. Ask students to think about one way a ball could roll.</p>
	<ul><li>Ask students to think about one way a ball could roll if it weren’t rolling in a straight line. &#10174; bounce off a wall; roll down a slope; roll up a hill</li>
	<li>Draw some student suggestions that could be posted around the room as students continue to build on their understanding of pushes 
	and pulls with the goal of building a miniature golf course.</li></ul></p>
