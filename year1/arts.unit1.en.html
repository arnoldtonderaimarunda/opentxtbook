        <h1>MODULE 1 - Emergent Reading and Writing Skills</h1>Learning Attitude & Exercise Assessment
        <img src='media/tutorials/arts.unit1.module1.ataglance.png' width=95% height=95% class='float_right'>
       	<p><h3>Warm up - 10 minutes.</h3><h4>Counting with Fingers.</h4>
	<blockquote><strong>Note:</strong> In this exercise students will practice counting to 10 using their fingers.
	This task is important because it visually emphasizes that a word (one, two,
	etc.) is an individual entity that can be represented, in this case, with fingers.
	This exercise will be repeated at the beginning of each lesson in Unit 1. If you
	find that counting to 10 is too difficult for students at this point, have them
	count to five and increase to 10 when students are ready.</blockquote>
	<ul><li>Count from one to 10, lifting one finger for each number as you count.</li>
	<li>Have students repeat after you.</li></ul></p>

	<p><h3>Listening to Environmental Noises - 20 minutes.</h3><h4>Knocking and Counting. <small>10 minutes</small></h4>
	<blockquote><strong>Note:</strong> This exercise is important because it requires students to distinguish
	discrete noises (in this case, knocks). This is similar to distinguishing
	discrete sounds in spoken words. The ability to distinguish sounds is a
	prerequisite for writing; to write a word, you must know how many sounds
	are in the word so you can write a spelling for each sound.</blockquote>
	<ul><li>Tell students to listen and watch as you knock on your desk.</li>
	<li>Knock on your desk one to three times with your right hand. As you knock,
	raise one finger on your left hand for each knock, starting with your thumb.
	(To students, you should appear to be lifting your fingers from left to right.)</li>
	<li>Repeat the knocks at a slower pace, having students raise one finger for each
	knock (ideally from left to right, but do not dwell on this).</li>
	<li>Have students hold up their hands, indicating with their raised fingers how
	many times you knocked.</li>
	<li>Repeat several times, varying the number of knocks.</li></ul></p>

	<p><h4>Same or Different? <small>10 minutes.</small></h4><hl>
	<blockquote><strong><p>Note:</strong> This exercise familiarizes students with the sources of noises and
	helps them to discriminate between them.</p><p>For this exercise, students need to know the meanings of
	the terms <em>same</em> and <em>different</em>. Make two noises that are the same and tell students two noises that sound alike are the
	<em>same</em>. Make two noises that are different and tell students two noises that do not sound alike are <em>different</em>.</p></blockquote>
	<ul><li>Gather various rhythm instruments or classroom objects which make distinctive noises; e.g., stapler, pencil sharpener, scissors, etc.</li>
	<li>Familiarize students with the instruments or objects and the noises they make by naming them and producing the noises.</li>
	<li>Make two noises and ask students whether the noises were the same or different.</li>
	<li>If students are successful, repeat with the instruments or objects now hidden from view.</li></ul></p>

       	<p><h3>Left/Right Discrimination - 10 minutes.</h3><h4>Greeting.</h4>
	<blockquote><p><strong>Note:</strong> Shaking hands teaches human social skills. Additionally, a firm grip
	develops hand awareness and increases muscle tone in the hand, which is
	useful for writing. Finally, this exercise familiarizes students with their right
	hands (and with the concept of “right” in general). This knowledge will be
	beneficial when students are taught to read and write from left to right.</p><p>Please be aware that greeting
	a person by shaking his or her hand and looking him or her in the eyes is not a universal social tradition. Additionally,
	please note this exercise may be difficult for autistic students</p></blockquote>
	<ul><li>Tell students when we greet a person we shake the person’s right hand.</li><li>Greet one student after the other by saying hello, looking him or her in the
	eyes, and firmly shaking his or her right hand.</li><li>Say, “Hello,____ . We greet others by shaking their right hand. I’m using my right hand to shake your right hand.”</li>
	<li>Encourage students to greet you properly, “Hello,____ . I’m using my right hand to shake your right hand.”</li></ul></p>

       	<p><h3>Spatial and Bodily Awareness - 5 minutes.</h3><h4>Follow me.</h4>
	<blockquote><p><strong>Note:</strong>This exercise familiarizes students with position words, which you will use when teaching letter forms and when teaching the directionality
	of reading and writing (top to bottom/left to right). It also develops gross motor skills.</p><p>A squishy object gives
	students plenty of sensory feedback as they move the object in space. If possible,have students use a soft object for this exercise.</blockquote>
	<ul><li>Give each student a beanbag, foam ball, or another small object.</li><li>Have students stand about an arm’s length apart.</li>
	<li>Stand with your back to students and tell them to do what you do.</li>
	<li>Make sure to emphasize the position words <em>top, bottom, over, under, right,other side</em>, and <em>around</em> by saying what you are doing.</li>
	<li>You should do the following actions in order before varying the game:<ul><li>Move the ball to the <strong>top</strong> of your head.</li>
	<li>Lift up your foot and move the ball down to the <strong>bottom</strong> of your foot.</li>
	<li>Raise your arm sideways and move the ball <strong>over</strong> your arm.</li>
	<li>Raise your arm sideways and move the ball <strong>under</strong> your arm.</li>
	<li>Move the ball to the <strong>right</strong> of your body.</li>
	<li>Move the ball to the <strong>other side</strong> of your body.</li>
	<li>Move the ball <strong>around</strong> your legs.</li></ul></li></ul>
	<blockquote><strong>Note:</strong>The position word <em>left</em> is avoided here to emphasize the right hand and right side of the body.</blockquote></p>

       	<p><h3>Drawing - 15 minutes.</h3><h4>Drawing on a Vertical Surface.</h4>
	<blockquote><strong>Note:</strong> In this exercise students will learn to control movement at the shoulder, elbow, wrist, and fingers to make marks on paper with small
	crayons. The small size of the crayons encourages the pincer grasp, which leads into the efficient tripod grip. The tripod grip will be taught in the next
	lesson.</blockquote>
	<ul><li>Set up drawing paper on an easel or some other large, vertical surface at a height students can reach.</li>
	<li>Provide students with small pieces of crayon.</li><li>Have students draw on the vertical surface. Encourage a range of motion,
	from large movements made at the shoulder and elbows to small movements made at the wrists and fingers.</li></ul></p>

	<p><h3>Listening to Environmental Noises - 20 minutes.</h3><h4>Knocking and Counting. <small>10 minutes</small></h4>
	<ul><li>Tell students to listen and watch as you knock on your desk.</li>
	<li>Knock on your desk one to four times with your right hand. As you knock,
	raise one finger on your left hand for each knock, starting with your thumb.
	(To students, you should appear to be lifting your fingers from left to right.)</li>
	<li>Repeat the knocks at a slower pace, having students raise one finger for each

	<p><h4>Same or Different? <small>10 minutes.</small></h4><hl>
	<ul><li>Gather various rhythm instruments or classroom objects which make distinctive noises.</li>
	<li>Familiarize students with the instruments or objects and the noises they make by naming them and producing the noises.</li>
	<li>Make two noises and ask students whether the noises were the same or different.</li>
	<li>Repeat until students have had significant practice.</li>
	<li>If students are successful, repeat with the instruments or objects now hidden from view.</li>
	<li>Extension: Arrange a number of instruments or objects so students can see
	them. Have another set of these same instruments or objects hidden. Make
	the noise of an instrument or object out of view and ask students to identify
	the instrument or object making the same noise. Repeat and ask them to
	select an instrument or object making a different noise. You could also hand
	one instrument or object to each student and ask them to make the same
	noise or a different noise.</li></ul></p>

	<p><h3>Left/Right Discrimination - 5 minutes.</h3><h4>Greeting.</h4>
	<ul><li>Greet one student after the other by saying hello, looking him or her in the
	eyes, and firmly shaking his or her right hand.</li><li>Say, “Hello,____ . We greet others by shaking their right hand. I’m using my right hand to shake your right hand.”</li>
	<li>Encourage students to greet you properly, “Hello,____ . I’m using my right hand to shake your right hand.”</li><li>After shaking each student’s right hand, place a small sticker on it to remind
	him or her which side is the right side.</li><li>Tell students, “What’s left is left.”</li></ul></p>

       	<p><h3>Spatial and Bodily Awareness - 10 minutes.</h3><h4>Follow me.</h4>
	<ul><li>Give each student a beanbag, foam ball, or another small object.</li><li>Have students stand about an arm’s length apart.</li>
	<li>Stand with your back to students and tell them to do what you do.</li>
	<li>Make sure to emphasize the position words <em>top, bottom, over, under, right,other side</em>, and <em>around</em> by saying what you are doing.</li>
	<li>You should do the following actions in order before varying the game:<ul><li>Move the ball to the <strong>top</strong> of your head.</li>
	<li>Lift up your foot and move the ball down to the <strong>bottom</strong> of your foot.</li>
	<li>Raise your arm sideways and move the ball <strong>over</strong> your arm.</li>
	<li>Raise your arm sideways and move the ball <strong>under</strong> your arm.</li>
	<li>Move the ball to the <strong>right</strong> of your body.</li>
	<li>Move the ball to the <strong>other side</strong> of your body.</li>
	<li>Move the ball <strong>around</strong> your legs.</li></ul></li>
	<li>Extension: As students master position words, increase the length of your statements and make them more explicit. For example, say, “Move the ball
	to the middle of your right arm, under your elbow.” To make this an excellent oral language exercise, have students say what they are doing.</li></ul>

       	<p><h3>Finger/Hand Exercise - 10 minutes.</h3><h4>Finger Introduction. <small>5 minutes</small></h4>
	<blockquote><strong>Note:</strong> This exercise is important because knowing finger names is useful for learning the tripod grip. Having students practice
	finger-thumb opposition (touching the thumb to each finger) is a great way to prepare students for the tripod grip. When students begin writing, you may have
	them practice finger-thumb opposition for 30 seconds before asking them to pick up a writing uten</blockquote>
	<ul><li>Raise your thumb, and tell students you are holding up your thumb.</li>
	<li>Raise each of your remaining fingers (one at a time), and tell students what they are called (<em>pointer</em> or <em>index finger, middle finger, ring finger, pinkie</em>).</li>
	<li>Tell students to touch their thumbs to the tips of their other fingers. This movement is called finger-thumb opposition and develops finger awareness</li>
	</li>Tell students to repeat after you, pretending their thumbs are greeting each of their fingers.<ul>
	<li>Touch your thumb to your pointer finger, and say, “Hello, pointer finger! Hello, thumb!”</li>
	<li>Touch your thumb to your middle finger, and say, “Hello, middle finger! Hello, thumb!”</li>
	<li>Touch your thumb to your ring finger, and say, “Hello, ring finger! Hello, thumb!”</li>
	<li>Touch your thumb to your pinkie, and say, “Hello, pinkie! Hello, thumb!”</li></ul></li>
	<li>Extension: Sing the song “Where Is Thumbkin?” (to the tune of “Frère Jacques”).<blockquote>
	<p>Where Is Thumbkin?</p>
	<p>“Where is thumbkin?” <small>(hands behind back)</small></p>
	<p>“Where is thumbkin?” <small>(hands behind back)</small></p>
	<p>“Here I am.” <small>(bring left thumb from behind back)</small></p>
	<p>“Here I am.” <small>(bring right thumb from behind back)</small></p>
	<p>“How are you today, sir?” <small>(wiggle left thumb)</small></p>
	<p>“Very well, I thank you.” <small>(wiggle right thumb)</small></p>
	<p>“Run away.” <small>(move left hand behind back)</small></p>
	<p>“Run away.” <small>(move right hand behind back)</small></p>
	<p><small>(Repeat four times, replacing “thumbkin” with “pointer finger,” then “middle finger,” then “ring finger,” and then “pinkie.”)</small></p></blockquote></li></ul></p>	
	
	<p><h4>Introducing the Tripod Grip <small>5 minutes.</small></h4><hl>
	<blockquote><strong><p>Note:</strong> The standard writing grip is the tripod grip. The tripod grip is made by pinching the base of a writing utensil with the thumb and pointer finger
	and resting the shaft of the writing utensil on the tip of the middle finger.</p>
	<img src='media/tutorials/arts.unit1.module2.tripodgrip.png' width=30% height=30% class='float_right'>
	</blockquote>
	<ul><li>Provide each student with a small piece of crayon.</li>
	<li>Model the tripod grip for students.</li>
	<li>Have students use the tripod grip to hold their crayons</li>
	<li>Circulate, correcting grips. (It is important that students learn the correct way to hold a writing utensil because a proper grip ensures efficient, smooth, and
	tension-free handwriting.)</li></ul><blockquote><strong><p>Note:</strong> Some students might use the thumb, pointer finger, and middle finger to pinch the crayon. 
	The crayon then rests on the tip of the ring finger. This alternate grip, called the <em>quadropod</em> grip, is fine as well.</blockquote></p>

	<p><h3>Drawing Time - 10 minutes.</h3><h4>Drawing Vertical Lines on a Vertical Surface.</h4>
	<blockquote><strong>Note:</strong> Drawing vertical lines will prepare students to write the letters ‘a’, ‘b’,
	‘d’, ‘h’, ‘i’, ‘k’, ‘l’, ‘m’, ‘n’, ‘p’, ‘q’, ‘r’, ‘t’, and ‘u’. If students have trouble drawing vertical lines, 
	you may draw stars on the paper to indicate where they should start each vertical line. Tell students 
	to “start at the star.” If necessary, draw dots to indicate end points, and tell students to “stop at the dot.”</blockquote>
	<ul><li>Tape multiple pieces of chart paper to the wall at a height students can reach.</li>
	<li>Review the position words top, bottom, left, right, and middle with students,pointing out the <em>top, bottom, left side, right side,</em> and <em>middle</em> of one of the
	pieces of chart paper.</li><li>Draw a vertical line on the board. Explain to students a vertical line is a straight line that goes up and down; when we draw a vertical line, we start at
	the top and finish at the bottom.</li><li>Invite students to trace vertical lines on their desks (or in the air) with their fingers.</li>
	<li>Have students draw vertical lines on the chart paper.</li><li>Circulate, correcting grips and assisting students in drawing vertical lines.</li></ul></p>

	<p><h3>Drawing - 15 minutes.</h3><h4>Drawing on a Vertical Surface.</h4>
	<blockquote><strong>Note:</strong> In this exercise students will learn to control movement at the shoulder, elbow, wrist, and fingers to make marks on paper with small
	crayons. The small size of the crayons encourages the pincer grasp, which leads into the efficient tripod grip. The tripod grip will be taught in the next
	lesson.</blockquote>
	<ul><li>Set up drawing paper on an easel or some other large, vertical surface at a height students can reach.</li>
