        <h1>MODULE 1 - Explore Connecting Cubes</h1>
      	<p><h3>Warm-up - 10 minutes.</h3><h4>Notice and Wonder: Connecting Cubes</h4>
        <blockquote><strong>Note:</strong> The purpose of this activity is to elicit ideas students have about connecting cubes. Students learn the
	<em>Notice and Wonder</em> routine which will be used throughout the year. This routine provides an opportunity for all students to contribute to 
	the conversation and for the teacher to listen to what knowledge students already have. For all of the routines, consider establishing a small, discreet hand signal that students
	can display to indicate they have an answer they can support with reasoning. This signal could be a thumbs-up, a certain number of fingers that tells the number of responses they have, 
	or another subtle signal. This is a quick way to see if students have had enough time to think about the problem. It also keeps students from being distracted or rushed by hands being 
	raised around the class. A picture of connecting cubes is provided in worksheet below. However, it is preferable to display a collection of actual connecting cubes. 
	Students also have at least one connecting cube to examine up close.</blockquote>
     	<strong><p style="color:blue;">&#8623; Download <a href='media/maths.unit1.module1.worksheet1.pdf' class='sticky' target='_blank'>Notice and Wonder: Connecting Cubes</a> worksheet.</p></strong>


       	<p><h3>Activity - 15 minutes.</h3><h4>Introduce Connecting Cubes</h4>
	<blockquote><strong>Note:</strong> The purpose of this activity is for students to explore and use connecting cubes. Students have an
	opportunity to explore the connecting cubes before they are asked to use them to represent
	mathematical situations in later lessons. As students work, observe whether students sort, count,
	or use comparison language while working with connecting cubes. Students will have
	opportunities to continue exploring connecting cubes in centers in future lessons.</blockquote>
	<ul><li>Ask students "A tool is a thing that you use to help you do something. A crayon is a tool. I use
	crayons to add different colors to the pictures that I draw. What are some tools that you and your family use at home?" (My
	grandfather uses a spoon to stir the soup. My mom uses a hammer to hang up pictures. I use a stool to help me reach the sink.)</li>
	<li>Give a container of connecting cubes to each group.</li><li>Have students make or do something with connecting cubes.</li>
	<li>Have students share what they did or made with connecting cubes.</li></ul></p>

	<p><h3>Synthesis - 10 minutes.</h3><h4>Maths Community</h4>
	<blockquote><strong>Note:</strong> The purpose of this sythesis is for students to what it looks and sounds like to do maths together. What the teacher does. What the student does. Sunch as; Both
	talk to each other. Both make quiet time to think. Both share their ideas. Both thought about the mathematical ideas and words they know. Students will write down their answers. 
	Teacher will wait until students give the answers.</blockquote>
	<ul><li>Prepare a space, such as a piece of poster paper, titled “Math Community” and a T-chart with the header “Doing Maths.” Partition the column into two sections: students and teachers. 
	The two sections encourage the students and teacher to be mindful that both respective parties are responsible for the way maths is being done in the classroom.</li></ul></p>
